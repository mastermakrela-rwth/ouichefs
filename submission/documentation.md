## Process

You will submit your work on the Moodle platform as a `tar.gz` archive. This archive needs to contain the modified sources of ouiche_fs with no residual files from builds (object files, binaries, etc.), as well as a short `pdf` report (2–4 pages). This report should contain explanations about your design choices (algorithms and data structures) and a status report with the following three sections:

- List of features implemented and functional
- List of features implemented but not fully functional. In this case, explain the problems, why they occur, and potential fixes if you have any in mind.
- List of features not implemented.

The project must be done in **groups of two students**. You should already have registered your groups by now.

The deadline is **Monday 26 February at 23h59**.

## Grading

You will be evaluated with functional tests (does your code work?), as well as on the quality and readability of your code (don’t forget to use the scripts/checkpatch.pl script from the kernel sources, respect the kernel coding style rules, and comment your code). Similarly for the report, please make it easy to understand and run a spell checker. The report itself will not be graded, but if it is hard to understand, it will make it harder for us to give you more points.
