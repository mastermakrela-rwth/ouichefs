== Helper functions for eviction policies

In `eviction_policy/eviction_policy.h/.c` you will find helper functions that
are used in the implementations of the eviction policies. These functions are:

+ A default eviction policy that serves as a fallback, if no other eviction policy
  is specified. It does nothing.
+ `register_eviction_policy` and `unregister_eviction_policy` to register and
  unregister eviction policies.
+ `set_eviction_policy` to set which eviction policy is to be used.
+ `traverse_dir` is used to recursively traverse directory. It is very flexible,
  which allows us to use it in different eviction policies by adjusting the
  functionality that is passed to it.
+ `ouichefs_remove_file` is our implementation of deleting a file based on whether
  we have the `dentry` available or not.
+ `ouichefs_file_in_use` is used to check whether a file is used. We know that
  this approach by iterating over every process, grabbing their open files and
  checking their inode against our inode is highly inefficient. However, our
  attempts to use the `i_count` field of `struct inode` failed as there were many
  side effects increasing and also not increasing the `i_count` field in a way we
  needed it to. We really spent a lot of time on this issue and did not find a
  better way to solve this issue.

== Eviction policies

In both eviction policies you will find the following functions:
+ `clean_dir` gets called when a directory is full and we need to free up space as
  another file is to be created.
+ `clean_partition` gets called when the partition exceeds a given threshold.
+ `leaf_action` performs some action on a file (leaf). Depending on the eviction
  policy it compares whether the file is to be deleted or not.
+ A data structure to track which file is to be deleted

=== Least Recently Used (LRU)

In `wich_lru.c` you will find the implementation of the LRU eviction policy. The
ease of just modifying the `is_older` function to depend on either `i_atime`,
`i_mtime` or `i_ctime` makes it very flexible and enabled us to implement three
eviction strategies with minimal effort.

The default eviction policy is LRU (based on `i_ctime`). You can dynamically
change the policy when inserting the module.

```bash
insmod wich_lru.ko mode=1 # i_atime
insmod wich_lru.ko mode=2 # i_mtime
insmod wich_lru.ko mode=3 # i_ctime, default
```

`clean_partition` collects basic information about the files in the partition
and starts the traversal of the partition to find the file to be deleted. It
uses `traverse_dir` to traverse the directories and to pass the information to
`leaf_action` of the current eviction policy to determine whether the current
node is e.g. the least-recently used.

Based on the inode that gets returned, we lastly perform `null` checks and
prevent the deletion of the root directory. If these checks pass, we call
`ouichefs_remove_file` to delete the file.

In `clean_dir` we can iterate over every file in the given directory and compare
them using `is_older` to find the file to delete. We run into an error if the
current folder only contains directories.

If we find a file to delete, we call `ouichefs_remove_file` to delete the file.

=== Size-based eviction

Most of the parts of this eviction policy are similar to the LRU eviction
policy. As we do not want to repeat ourselves, we want to highlight the
differences.

In `wich_size.c` you will find the implementation of the size-based eviction
policy.

Instead of comparing dates in `leaf_action`, we compare the sizes of files to
find the largest one.

`clean_partition` works exactly the same as in the LRU eviction policy, except
we pass a different function to `traverse_dir` to compare the sizes of the files
and another data structure to keep track of the largest file. Afterwards the
same checks are performed to prevent the deletion of the root directory and to
delete the file.

Again, `clean_dir` works exactly the same as in the LRU eviction policy, except
we search for the biggest file instead of the oldest before deleting.

== Printing policy

You will also find a eviction policy `wich_print.c` that will not evict
anything. This eviction policy is used to print file and inode information that
were very handy during the development of the eviction policies in a tree like
fashion.

It gets triggered like every other policy.

== Automatic eviction

The two scenarios in which the eviction process is triggered are:
+ When a directory is full and we need to free up space as another file is to be
  created. You can see our implementation in `ouichefs_create` in `inode.c`.
+ When the partition exceeds a given threshold, which can be configured when
  inserting the `ouichefs` module (see @base-setup). The triggering of the
  eviction process is implemented in `ouichefs_write_end` in `file.c`.

== Base setup <base-setup>

To compile our project you should be able to use the `Makefile` in the root
directory. `make install` will additionally move the `ko` files and our
`scripts` directory to the specified path in the virtual machine.

```bash
make
make install
```

To use the eviction policies mechanism, you need to insert the `ouichefs` module
and your preferred policy module(s) (You can configure which inserted module is
active, see @change-policies). Of course, you also have to have a partition
using ouichefs mounted.

```bash
insmod ouichefs.ko trigger_threshold=50
./scripts/mount.sh test.img
```

You can set the trigger threshold to a value of your choice. The default is 20
%, meaning that if 80 % of the partitions blocks are used, the eviction process
is triggered.

Afterwards you can insert the eviction policies of your choice.

```bash
insmod wich_size.ko
insmod wich_lru.ko
```

== Changing eviction policies <change-policies>

You can retrieve the available eviction policies by using the following command:

```bash
cat /proc/ouiche/eviction
```

```bash
Following eviction policies are available:
default (does nothing)
wich_size
wich_lru        [ACTIVE]
```

By default the last inserted policy is active. You can change the active policy
with:

```bash
echo -n "wich_size" > /proc/ouiche/eviction
```

```bash
ouichefs:evictions_proc_write: Received policy name: wich_size
set eviction policy to 'wich_size'
```

== Triggering manual eviction

To manually trigger the eviction process, you need the target partition. You can
retrieve the available partitions of ouichefs with:

```bash
cat /proc/ouiche/partitions
```

```bash
Following partitions use ouiche_fs:
0:/dev/loop1
```
You can then manually trigger the eviction process with:

```bash
echo -n "0:/dev/loop1" > /proc/ouiche/clean
```

== Removing the modules

You can remove the module with:

```bash
./scripts/umount.sh test.img
rmmod wich_size.ko
rmmod wich_lru.ko
rmmod ouichefs.ko
```

= List of features implemented but not fully functional/not implemented

According to the requirements, we have implemented every feature that was
required. We performed extensive testing and are confident that our
implementation is functional.

= List of bugs

We have found two possible bug and fixed one of them.

== Bug 1: Minimal size of the image

In `mkfs/mkfs-ouichefs.c` the check for the minimal size used $â‰¤$ instead of
$<$.

```diff
-if (stat_buf.st_size <= min_size) {
+if (stat_buf.st_size < min_size) {
```

== Bug 2: `.` and `..` missing in `ls`

We have found that `.` and `..` are missing in the output of `ls`. But we have
not found a solution for this issue.
